  </body>

<!-- Question -->
<!-- How does the paragraph look like? why? -->

<!-- EXPLANATION -->
<!-- The paragraph color is white but the background is blue. The priority is with p.info selector because it specifies a specific tag and it has class which is in higher priority so the css first runs the p.info and then it runs the p selector at top -->
